@Shepherd High School:


> On Wednesday, October 19th, all 11th grade students will be taking the PSAT test in the morning. All juniors are asked to report to the auxiliary gymnasium no later than 8am.

> ###Why take the PSAT?
* To see how your academic skills compare to those of other college-bound juniors across the nation. You can use this information to select appropriate classes in high school to help you prepare for college. 
* To begin the college search process. You can place your name in a pool of college-bound students interested in receiving admission and financial aid information from participating universities and scholarship agencies. 
* To practice for the SAT---one of the two admissions tests accepted by every college in the country. Students who take the PSAT typically do better on the SAT than those who do not. 
*  To enter the National Merit Scholarship Competition---Juniors who take the PSAT are automatically considered for this and other scholarship/recognition programs.
